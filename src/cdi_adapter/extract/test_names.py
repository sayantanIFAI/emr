"""Is this "test" really a test? A guard on the lab-test list.

A reader that struggles with a crowded handwritten page sometimes files a drug line under the tests the doctor
ordered ("In Candilock (lots)" for "Inj Cardiloc (10/5)"). Nothing may show a medicine as a lab test, so each
entry is checked for the marks of a medicine order: a form prefix (Inj, Tab, Cap, Syp ...), a dose or strength,
a frequency, a duration. A name that is a known test (CBC, KFT, TSH, ECG ...) is never rejected on those marks.
This only ever REMOVES an entry from the tests; it never invents one.
